## :pencil:Project Description : ##

**The core idea of the Project is to build a sample prototype Travel commutation Website with azure static web apps for a business company with the help of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and BOOTSTRAP. The primary goal of a sample prototype of a travel site is to sell online and offline services with solving the problems of customers speedily via azure static web app technology. This project deals with developing a travel website for tourism and tour guidance. It provides the user with a catalog of different tourism and travel services available for purchase. In order to facilitate online service purchases, service detail is provided to the user. We are using Azure Technologies with GitHub to complete this project.**

**Azure Web App Service (Static) : The project uses Azure Website hosting services, which are meant to host websites that don't require running any ASP.NET code. This service is built with Static HTML files, the Azure Web Apps have built-in support for several content management systems and allow you to deploy your own custom CMS or use the one provided at no charge. You can host your website with a globally distributed CDN of edge nodes, which provides higher performance and lower latency for your visitors all over the world. Your website is completely dependent on Microsoftâ€™s cloud infrastructure for its availability and is always up-to-date using continuous deployment technology.**
